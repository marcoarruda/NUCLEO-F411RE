# NUCLEO-F411RE

### Introduction
The main goal of this project is to provide a cheap and powerful hardware for didactic mobile robots

### Development
The development follows the planning on this [link](https://github.com/marcoarruda/NUCLEO-F411RE/projects/1)

### Hardware
It is being developed using an ARM based microcontroller from ST ([link](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f411re.html)) with a shield from the same company with motion sensors ([link](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/solution-evaluation-tools/sensor-solution-eval-boards/x-nucleo-iks01a1.html))

### Software
The development is under a Windows machine with STM32CubeMX in order to generate the hardware configuration code and IAR EWARM to program and debug
